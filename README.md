## EventShare

### App Description
A common place to track all social events happening nearby. The app has location-based "HUB"s, each of which allows users to add events to. Events can be public or private; everyone can see public events, and the app compiles a schedule for events that a user expresses interest in. Events can be listed under categories, such as "Music" or "Networking", and the app has built-in location trackers that calculate the commute time between events.

### App Idea Evaluation

- Mobile: Mobile is essential for the convenience and accessiblity of events on the go.
- Story: Users use the app to find events that they are interested in, and the app creates a customized schedule for each indivdual user.
- Market: Anyone that wants to have an interesting and involved life in their community.
- Habit: Once a large user base is built, this will be the app that everyone uses.
- Scope: V1 would allow people to post about public events in location-based "HUB"s. V2 would incorporate user accounts and customized schedules. V3 would add location-based functionalities. V4 would incorporate social networking, friending of users, and affiliation with companies / institutions / groups. V5 would allow for private and invite-only events.
